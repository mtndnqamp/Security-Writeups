# Try Hack Me soc_1
> this write up was initially written for a subject at university, but has been adapted for the writeup repo


This program was a crash course in the most common “blue team” related tools and techniques. THM’s SOC 1 taught everything from digital forensics to incident response, to even cyber threat intelligence. I selected this program as I wanted to gain experience in the digital forensics and Incident response space.

The program was broken into several modules, each covering their own area, with 4 “capstone” challenges at the end. Each module had its own challenges, some where more technical, diving into memory dump analysis or reg key forensics, while others focused on overall workflows and strategies a SOC analyst may use. 

The most interesting part of the program for me was the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) section. CTI is a niche topic that does not normally get covered in university courses. It centres on identifying a threat actors tactics, techniques, procedures (TTP’s) and Indicators of compromise (IOC’s). these markers can then be used for threat hunting and assessment activities to provide direction into how to better secure an organisations digital environment.

The section I struggled with the most was the digital forensics module. This module covered how SOC analysts sifted through a compromised computers logs and files to identify how it could have been infected. This is an important part of SOC activities as it can help analysts identify the TTP an adversary used to compromise a victim’s machine. Activities in this module included: inspecting memory dumps, analysing windows event logs, sifting through various device and network logs, and investigating disk images to name a few. The challenge I had with this was I was not too familiar with the tooling and investigation workflows. This module taught me a lot about distilling the information in front of you to only what’s important, and walking though the investigation step by step, following the threat actor from the point of compromise, right through to exfiltration. 

Overall, I’m happy with my completion of THM SOC 1. I believe that I learnt a lot about both tooling and workflows in the cyber security industry. The skills and techniques I learnt from the course will serve me well as I start my career in the industry.
